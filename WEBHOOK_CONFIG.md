# AI Analysis and Ranking webhook (using same URL for now)
VITE_N8N_AI_WEBHOOK_URL=https://omarossama.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/e20c92ab-a227-4cee-9558-e82ebcb3d7af
```

  status: 'Synced',
  priority: task.priority
}));

return [{
  json: {
    message: `Successfully synced ${tasks.length} task(s)`,

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unable to connect to n8n"

**Solutions:**
1. Check n8n workflow is **Active** (toggle in top-right)
2. Verify webhook URL is correct in `.env`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Check n8n execution history for errors
5. Try test with curl command first

### Issue: "CORS Error"

n8n automatically handles CORS, but if you see CORS errors:
1. In n8n workflow, add to "Respond to Webhook" node:
   - Response Headers:
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS`

### Issue: No response from webhook

**Check:**
1. n8n workflow has "Respond to Webhook" node
2. All nodes are connected
3. No errors in n8n execution logs
4. Webhook path matches exactly

### Issue: Tasks not updating

**Check:**
1. Response format matches expected structure
2. `updatedTasks` array exists in response
3. Task IDs match between request and response
4. Status field is spelled correctly: "Synced" (capital S)
