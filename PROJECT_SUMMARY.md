### 2. Why Tailwind CSS?
- **Rapid development**: Utility classes speed up styling
- **Consistent design**: Predefined spacing, colors
- **Responsive by default**: Mobile-first approach
- **Small bundle size**: PurgeCSS removes unused styles
- **Modern aesthetic**: Professional look out-of-the-box

### 3. Why Framer Motion?
- **Smooth animations**: 60fps performance
- **Easy to use**: React-friendly API
- **Powerful features**: Spring physics, gesture support
- **Small footprint**: Tree-shakeable
- **Enhanced UX**: Delightful micro-interactions

### 4. Why n8n?
- **Visual workflow builder**: No-code automation
