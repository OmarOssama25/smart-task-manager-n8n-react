## 🔧 Current Server Info

**Server URL**: Check your terminal for the port (likely 5175 or 5176)
**n8n Webhook**: `https://omarossama.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/e20c92ab-a227-4cee-9558-e82ebcb3d7af`

---

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Step 1: Check the Console

Open your browser at the URL shown in terminal, then:
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Look for these messages in the Console:
   ```
   🔧 N8N Webhook URL: https://omarossama.app.n8n.cloud/...
   🔧 Env variable: https://omarossama.app.n8n.cloud/...
   ```

### Step 2A: If You See Your n8n URL ✅

Great! Environment variables are loaded! Now:
1. Add some tasks in the app
2. Click "Sync with n8n"
3. You'll see an error (expected - workflow doesn't exist yet)
4. Go to n8n and create the workflow
5. Test again - should work!

### Step 2B: If You Still See `webhook.site` ❌

The environment variables aren't loading. Try this manual workaround:
1. Open `src/App.jsx` in your editor
2. Find line 30: `const N8N_WEBHOOK_URL = ...`
3. Replace with:
   ```javascript
   const N8N_WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://omarossama.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/e20c92ab-a227-4cee-9558-e82ebcb3d7af';
   ```
4. Save and test again

## 🔗 n8n Workflow Setup

You need to create a workflow in n8n before sync will work.

### Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. **Go to**: https://omarossama.app.n8n.cloud
2. **Click**: "New Workflow"
3. **Add Node 1**: Webhook
   - HTTP Method: POST
   - Path: `webhook-test/e20c92ab-a227-4cee-9558-e82ebcb3d7af`
   - Respond: "Using 'Respond to Webhook' node"

4. **Add Node 2**: Code
   - Paste this code:
   ```javascript
   const tasks = $input.item.json.tasks || [];
   const updatedTasks = tasks.map(task => ({
     id: task.id,
     title: task.title,
     status: 'Synced',
     priority: task.priority
   }));
   
   return [{
     json: {
       message: `Successfully synced ${tasks.length} task(s)!`,
       updatedTasks: updatedTasks,
       lastSync: new Date().toISOString()
     }
   }];
   ```

5. **Add Node 3**: Respond to Webhook
   - Response Body: `{{ $json }}`
   - Status Code: 200

6. **Connect**: Webhook → Code → Respond to Webhook
7. **Click**: Save (top right)
8. **Toggle**: Active (green toggle in top right)

## 🧪 Testing Flow

### Test 1: Basic Features (No n8n needed)
1. Open the app
2. Add 2-3 tasks
3. Mark one complete
4. Delete one
5. Refresh page - tasks should persist ✅

### Test 2: n8n Sync (Requires workflow)
1. Ensure n8n workflow is Active
2. Add a task in the app
3. Click "Sync with n8n"
4. Watch for:
   - Loading spinner
   - Success toast
   - Task status → "Synced"
   - Last sync timestamp appears

### Test 3: Check n8n
1. Go to n8n dashboard
2. Click "Executions" in sidebar
3. Should see ✅ green successful execution
4. Click it to see your task data

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still Using `webhook.site` URL

**Why**: Environment variables not loading properly on Windows
**Solution**: Manually hardcode the URL in App.jsx (see Step 2B above)

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" when syncing

**Possible Causes**:
1. ❌ n8n workflow doesn't exist → Create it
2. ❌ n8n workflow not Active → Toggle it on
3. ❌ Wrong webhook path → Verify it matches exactly
4. ❌ No internet connection → Check connection

### Issue: Tasks don't update after sync

**Check**:
- n8n workflow has "Respond to Webhook" node
- Response includes `updatedTasks` array
- Each task has `id` and `status` fields
