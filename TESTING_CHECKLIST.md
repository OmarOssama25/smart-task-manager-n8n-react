### Phase 2: Test n8n Integration

Before testing sync, set up your n8n workflow:

#### Step 1: Create Basic n8n Workflow

1. Go to your n8n dashboard: https://omarossama.app.n8n.cloud
2. Create **New Workflow**
3. Add these nodes:

**Node 1: Webhook**
- Type: Webhook
- HTTP Method: POST
- Path: `webhook-test/e20c92ab-a227-4cee-9558-e82ebcb3d7af`
- Respond: "Using 'Respond to Webhook' node"

**Node 2: Code**
- Paste this code:
```javascript
const tasks = $input.item.json.tasks || [];
const updatedTasks = tasks.map(task => ({
  id: task.id,
  title: task.title,
  status: 'Synced',
  priority: task.priority
}));

return [{
  json: {
    message: `Successfully synced ${tasks.length} task(s)!`,
    updatedTasks: updatedTasks,
    lastSync: new Date().toISOString()
  }
}];
```

**Node 3: Respond to Webhook**
- Response Body: `{{ $json }}`
- Status Code: 200

4. **Connect**: Webhook ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Respond to Webhook
5. **Save** the workflow
6. **Activate** it (toggle switch in top-right corner)

#### Step 2: Test n8n Sync

1. In your app, add a task if you haven't already
2. Click **"Sync with n8n"** button in the navbar
3. **Watch for**:
   - Button shows "Syncing..." with spinner üîÑ
   - After 1-2 seconds: Success toast appears üéâ
   - Task status changes to "Synced" (blue badge)
   - "Last Synced" timestamp appears in navbar

4. **Check n8n Dashboard**:
   - Click **Executions** in sidebar
   - You should see a ‚úÖ green successful execution
   - Click it to see the task data

#### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ No error toasts
- ‚úÖ Tasks show "Synced" status
- ‚úÖ Green execution in n8n
- ‚úÖ Last sync timestamp updates

### Phase 3: Test AI Ranking (Advanced)

This requires OpenAI API configuration in n8n.

#### Skip This For Now If:
- You don't have OpenAI API key yet
- Want to focus on basic features first
- Running low on time

#### To Test AI Ranking:

1. Get OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com
2. Add to n8n Credentials
3. Import `n8n-workflow-ai-ranking.json`
4. In app, click **"AI Rank"** button
5. Watch tasks reorder with #1, #2, #3 ranks

**See AI_RANKING_GUIDE.md for detailed setup**

## üß™ Manual Tests to Try

### Test Scenario 1: Mixed Priorities
```
Add these tasks:
1. "Urgent: Fix production bug" - Today - Low
2. "Read documentation" - Next month - High
3. "Team meeting" - Tomorrow 10am - Medium

Expected after AI Rank:
#1: Urgent: Fix production bug (‚Üë High)
#2: Team meeting (‚úì Medium)
#3: Read documentation (‚Üì Low)
```

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Operations
```
1. Add 5 tasks
2. Mark 2 as complete
3. Delete 1 task
4. Sync with n8n
5. Refresh page

Expected: 
- 2 completed tasks remain
- Deleted task is gone
- Remaining tasks show "Synced"
- All data persists after refresh
```

### Test Scenario 3: Error Handling
```
1. Stop n8n workflow (deactivate it)
2. Try to sync
3. Expected: Error toast "Unable to connect to n8n"
4. Reactivate workflow
5. Sync again
6. Expected: Success!
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Sync button does nothing

**Check:**
```bash
# Open browser console (F12)
# Look for errors
# Check Network tab for failed requests
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `.env` file has correct webhook URL
2. Ensure dev server was restarted after creating `.env`
3. Check n8n workflow is Active

### Issue: "Unable to connect to n8n"

**Solutions:**
1. In n8n, toggle workflow Active (green)
2. Verify webhook path matches exactly
3. Test webhook with curl:
```bash
curl -X POST https://omarossama.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/e20c92ab-a227-4cee-9558-e82ebcb3d7af \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "hello"}'
```

### Issue: Tasks don't show "Synced" status

**Check n8n response format:**
- Must have `updatedTasks` array
- Each task needs `id` and `status: "Synced"`
- Response must be valid JSON

### Issue: No animations showing

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check console for Framer Motion errors
